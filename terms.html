        <p>The explanation and information provided on this page are only general and high level explanations and information on how to write your own <br>documnet of terms and conditions. You should not rely on this article as legal advice or as recommendation regarding what you should actually <br>do, because we cannot know in advance what are the specific terms you wish to establish between your business and your customers and visitors. <br>We recommended that you seek legal advice to help you understand and to assist you in the creation of your own Terms and Conditions.</p>
        <p class="legal">Terms & Conditions - The Basics</p>
        <p>Having said that, Terms and Conditions("T&C") are a set of legally binding terms defined by you, as the owner of this website.

           T&C should be defined according to the specific needs and nature of each website. For example, a website offering products to customers in a <br>
           commerce transactions requires T&C that are differnt from the T&C of a website only providing information (like a blog, a landing page, and so on) <br><br>br
           T&C provide you as the website owner the ability to protect youself from pottential legal exposure, but this may differ from jurdification to <br>
           jurdification, so make sure to recieve local legal advice if you are trying to protect yourself from legal exposure. 
        </p>

           that the website owner may change his or her offering in the future; the types of warranties the websitebowner gives his or her customers;<br>
           refernce to issues of intellectual property or copyrights, where relevant; the website owner's right to suspend or cancel a member's account;<br>
           and much, much more. <br><br><br>
